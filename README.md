The purpose of this repo is to store all bash scripts I make for QOL in Linux

# Type these commands to move all shell scripts to bin for global use
# Just gives my shell script puffcpbin permissions and moves that to bin
# Then running puffcpbin automates doing that for all other shell scripts
sudo chmod +x puffcpbin
sudo cp puffcpbin /usr/local/bin/
puffcpbin
